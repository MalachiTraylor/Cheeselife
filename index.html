			<p>As I see myself everyday I become to understand more about myself. I keep to myself a lot meaning that I'm independent and I keep my thoughts to myself a lot. I'll will be layedback all day (just chilling) enjoying and observing myself and my surroundings. I noticed how goofy I am when I'm with the people who I am most close to. I am a nice and kind person. I am supportive to anyone's cause as long it is benifiting them, myself and other people around. </p>
			<p> I am a persistant person and I am determine to do things that I'll know that will help me. No matter how tired I am, no matter what negative things that comes up in my head, no matter what anyone will say, I will do whatever I need to towards who and where I want to be. I am known to give myself more work when I tend to work with anything. I see it as easy to understand but other people see it as a long run and not much time managing. I am also a athlete. I like to be strong and I like to move a lot while being in a active environment.</p>
